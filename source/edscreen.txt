
To build a .COM file with the C/80 version of the Dr. Dobbs screen editor,
first get all the source files (*.C and *.H).  ED6.C contains the screen
handling functions, and is currently set up for VT52 controls, with
VT100 available as a #define option.  Modify this for your system.

Use the C compiler to create .ASM files for the following:
 EDSCREEN.C
 ED2.C
 ED3.C
 ED4.C
 ED5.C
 ED6.C
 ED7.C
 ED8.C
 ED9.C
 ED10.C

Then use Software Toolworks' AS to assemble EDSCREEN and create a .COM file
(the other .ASM files are automatically included).
